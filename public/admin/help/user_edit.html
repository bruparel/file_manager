<p>1. By far the most important thing to be aware of is that all fields that are shown with <strong>bold</strong> labels are required.  Therefore, if
you leave anyone of them blank inadvarently then the system will print an appropriate error message in red next to the field label.</p>
<p>2. You can enter comments here the same way that you can on the Notes page, and optionally send them as an email to the user.
They will appear here in the future as well as the Welcome page for the user (or Notes for Admins).</p>
<p>3. Note that is screen is for admins only - You can do several things here which are dangerous to be exposed to a user.  That is why a separate change
password screen is provided so that the users can change their password at any time.  However, there are occasions when the users will not remember their
passwords or just plain be mistyping it.  Under those circumstances, it is advisable for you, the admin, to reset their password from this screen since to
change their passwords, the users need to remember their <strong>old</strong> password correctly.  So it is a bit of catch-22.  Another reason that you have
to use this screen as an admin is that the email can also be changed from here if the user wants you to.  Just make sure that the username
and the email addresses are unique to this user :)</p>
