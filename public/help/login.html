<p>1. You need to enter your email and password for logging into the system.  If you have forgotten it and would like us to reset it for you, call us, and we will be happy to do it for you :)</p>
<p>2. Remember that the password is case-sensitive.  One of the most frequent reasons for not being able to log in
using a password that you think (or know) is right is that the Caps Lock key is turned on by mistake.  If you still cannot
login then call us again and we will happily reset it for you :)</p>
<p>3. A nice to know is that you can change your password at any time using the Change Password link on the menu panel.
You have to be able to log into the system before you can change your password though.  So this assumes a successful login.</p>
