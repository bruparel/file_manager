<p>1. By far the most important thing to be aware of is that all fields that are shown with <strong>bold</strong> labels are required.  Therefore, if
you leave anyone of them blank inadvarently then the system will print an appropriate error message in red next to the field label.</p>
<p>2. This note is for admins only - If you are creating a client's record on his behalf then please make sure that you <strong>link</strong> the client
record to his user record by choosing his email from the drop-down which is only visible to the admins.  When a registered client user is creating his
own client record then this linking happens automatically.</p>
