require 'stump'

# This is a plugin based on Jeremy McAnally's stump gem (http://www.github.com/jeremymcanally/stump)
# At the time this plugin was created, the gem was only available on the github gem repository which is scheduled 
# to be deactivated in early 2010.  Since the gem did not exist in gemcutter, we just threw together this little 
# plugin wrapper for the time being.
